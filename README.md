> A canteen of a school sells 10 different types of foods. These food types are placed in a shelf. Students can select foods while walking alongside the shelf and keep them on a tray. These trays are available at the entrance of the canteen. A student, after selecting the food, should proceed to the cashier with the food tray for the payment.

> You are asked to develop a Python program to calculate the payment due for a food tray. For this pupose, each food item is given a unique integer from 1 to 10.

| Food type  | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Unit Price** | 10.00 | 12.00 | 15.00 | 10.00 | 25.00 | 45.00 | 50.00 | 25.00 | 10.00 | 12.00 |

> Your teacher has requested you to write a python program to record the marks obtained by students at the term test. Each student had sat for the same three papers and each mark was given as an integer value out of 100 marks. Each student is identified by a unique index number which is also an integer. You should record the marks of each student in a text file named 'marks.txt' in the following format.

`_index_no_1,mark_11,mark_12,mark_13_`

`_index_no_2,mark_21,mark_22,mark_23_`

> Marks should be entered through the keyboard, one item at a time and the program should be terminated when -1 is entered as the index number

> The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
> `n x (n-1) x (n-2) .... 3 x 2 x 1`

## 2013

> You are required to write a Python program to find and display the maximum value of given 10 integers. The program should read integers one at a time.
